Like a dream or a voice on the wind, it calls to us.<br>
Return to your island home to bring forth the spirt.
<p>
Our oldest roots stretch back to KK8 in the dark mud of Kapiolani Park.  Well worth skipping Senior Year midterms for a shot to play on the alumni team as a current student.  The Caltech Reunion team, <i>The Sarcastic Fringeheads</i> (or 
as our cotton shirts said that year, Ceci N'est Pas une Fringehead Sarcastique).
<p>
I didn't know if I'd ever get back having moved to NYC.  Then I got to talking to Scottie, and he said "oh yeah we're going back. Let's get a bid together RIGHT NOW." And thus the infamous lorax was born and took our licks at KK17.  I was overjoyed to see the Fringeheads win the spirit award.  I felt doubly blessed when they invited me to join in the celebratory beverage -- my kaimana spirit shot glass has a spot of honor on the hearth.
<p>
KK18 was a sad time.  We secured a bid but couldn't get momentum to get over the hump of 14 hour travel times from NY.
<p>
KK20 brought forth a new plan: Scott just went to watch.  Is that retirement I hear creeping up?  A decade between Kaimana visits is just too long!
<p>
The call of the West is strong.  The sirens of youth call forth.  The mighty Pacific weaves a beautiful charm.  And so we have moved back to the shores of the pacific, here in Calironia.  Scott and I find ourselves back, and available, and with new frisbee friends to draw from.  Foca with his organizational and mingling skills have put us together a rockstar line ready to represent.  From the ashes of the lorax, we arise phoenix like, the hip-huck-apotomous.  Our spirit is still strong and our love runs deep.  I can't wait to party with you all again.
<p>
Aloha and Mahalo,
