The truth about the mysterious Hip Huck Apotomous!
<p>
The Hip-Huck-Apotomous story is a long and varied tale.
<p>  
Our blood line draw from the early paleolithic era with our most active of 
ancestors, the Hipposaourus.  His Latin name Hippolayoutamusmaximus.  This creature could be found in four glorious colors: green, yellow, purple and blue.
<p>
All the other creatures where jealous of the beautiful colors and now easily 
the hippos could form ultimate teams.  These original hippos where in really 
great shape since all they did was play ulti all day long.  An entire species built like Beau Kittridge and with a a better smile.   A far cry from 
the libelous image put forth by our nemesis Milton and his buddy Bradley.
<p>
This dnosaur was one of the first to become extinct which has had scholors 
perplexed for ages.  We are here to pass along the lost knowledge.  It was no meteor or ice age that did them in.  It was their love of the layout that got 
them.  It just wouldn't matter how close to the precipice or a dangling participle these hippos would bid on a perfect horizontal.  
<p>
One by one the entire species flung themselves off a cliff! As pangea broke 
apart our distant cousins where growing closer to extinction.
<p>
Alas, there were four that survived.  They happened to be a little more rotund.  One of each color, by a strange happenstance.  Since they could not move as fast as the others, they were stuck tossing it deep for the other hipposaurus.  Over the years they developed their hucking skills and become an elite force organizing the original ultimate body -- the Ultimate Hippos Association. 
<p>
This species resembles what we now know as Hippopotamus.  They were the Hip-Huck-Apotomous! 
<p>
We have rounded up the whole heard and brought them back again to take the field against the best that you can throw at us and to tell our story.  The story that Milton & Bradley left out.  Yes these hippos are hungry hungry!  But the didn't warn you that the the hungry, hungry hippos are hungry for the HUCK!
